# Project - UwU : The Multipurpose Controller

### Total Time Spent - 30.6 Hours IN  2.5 Days

## August 29 : Planning [6 Hours]

Acording to me evarything needs to be well planned before attempting to perform it so on the very first day , I just decided to plan for the project by first searching for the components that suits best for this ans also for their availability on lcsc , many of the items weren't there but i managed to make it with the available ones . Afterwards , I made a rough sketch on my notebook for the schematic and the layout of the pcb , the CAD design and the placement of the components on the pcb 


## August 30 : Schematic Designing [4.5 Hours]

This time i decided to use easyea for my project rather than what i use usually {KiCAD} cause the jlc work is too easy from there . This made my work easier , I also used netlabels for wiring instead of wiring completely . This saved a lot of time . I took a llittle time as i some components i chose werent in stock so i completely redesigned the plamning and schematic . Have a look at the images below

## August 31 : PCB WORK COMPLETED ALONG WITH THE CAD ON SAME DAY [6 + 9 Hours]

I just woke up from the bed and also it was sunday , a 4 hours of sleed and a lil time for food and all , I instantly turned on my CPU and got my hands on working on the PCB frst , I redesigned thsi 4 Times as I wanted it to be made as small it could be , i used a 6x4 cm pcb for it , this was the final i could do for a microconroller , rotary encoder and 4 full sized SK8126 LEDs .

I then focused on routing the pcb , used 2 vias and this was pretty simple , the LEDs were on other side so I used vias to wire them with the microcontroller on the upper side

I started the CAD work as soon as i finished the PCB , first i made the measurements of the pcb accurately and then designed the base . Have a look below

## GITHUB PLUS JLCPCB WORK [5 Hours]

The work wasn't finished here , the project too needed a github repo along with some time for the jlcpcb work. This took way too much time due to my slow network and a potato pc !
